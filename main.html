Hi! I'm Alexander Dymo (Oleksandr Dymo as written in my Ukrainian passport).
</p>
<p>
I created this web site to provide more information about myself. I'll try to include here
unofficial data among with the official. I believe the short CV or a name at the website
can not describe a personality. So this site is intended to provide all useful information
about myself. <i>Hint: try to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;Alexander%20Dymo&quot;&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF">
Google for my name</a> and you will know even more ;)</i>
</p>
<p>
I was born in 1979 in Mykolayiv, former USSR. Now it's a territory of Ukraine and I'm still living there with my parents
and grandparents.
</p>
<p>I'm a lecturer of Information Control Systems and Technologies Department in National University of Shipbuilding.
I'm also a co-founder and CTO of Ki-Inform company.</p>
<p>I'm the professional member of <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM - Association of Computer Machinery</a> since 2005.</p>
