Oh, Ruby has become a hot topic on KDE blogs again&nbsp;:) Let me also join with my 2 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_hryvnia">kopiykas</a>.

My taste of programming languages tells me Python is not good for me. I don't want to claim here Python is bad, it's just not the language of my choice.
</p>
<p>
There are two good things about Ruby. First - when I've started learning both Python and Ruby year ago Ruby was perceived "cool". Today I work on Ruby (and Rails) projects half-time and the language is still "cool". There's nothing like this feeling to be commited to something cool&nbsp;:) Good advertising you say. Yep, pretty good but there's also something inside me telling Ruby is cool&nbsp;;) Cornelius described that feeling in a more precise way.

The second good thing I found about Ruby is syntax. Surprise! Looking at the blogs and comments most people complain about perlish syntax. It's probably possible to write perlish code in Ruby but I barely see anyone does it. For example, what's wrong with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1968">Richard Dale's code</a>?
</p>
<p>
Honestly, syntax matters were the first to take my attention away from Python. I like <i>def initialize</i> more than <i>def __init__(self):</i>. I also like code blocks ending with <i>end</i> and not just backward indentation. Writing <i>self.foo</i> disturbs me more than <i>@foo</i>. My list of preferences is long&nbsp;:)

Ok, I'm sure Python is a great language but I like Ruby more!
