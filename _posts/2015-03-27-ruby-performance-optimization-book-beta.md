This book has everything you need to know about optimizing Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications. You'll learn all the tips and tricks that can get you up to 10x speedup (2x-7x is my own average, with 90x as a record). 

You'll see how to use the Ruby profiler when no tips and tricks work. You'll also find out how to make sure performance doesn't degrade after the optimization. 

And, while not in this beta release, the book will explain why Ruby is so slow and what you can do about that.
