I'm sitting here at one of the boring talks at RailsConf and have nothing to do, so I decided to blog a bit&nbsp;:)
</p>
<p>
Basically Ruby/Rails people are great Mac fans (see <a target="_blank" href="http://flickr.com/photos/ugocei/244414117/">this Flickr picture</a>). Some of them use Windows. But what's really interesting that there's a number of people who're using Linux here and all those people I've seen have KDE on their desktops. I don't know what is the most popular distro among them, but two Kubuntu addicts are sitting near me at this moment. And that's cool, isn't that&nbsp;:)
