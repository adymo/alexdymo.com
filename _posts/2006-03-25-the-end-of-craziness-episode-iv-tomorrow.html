Ok, thanks to all Gods people ever beleived in! Ukraine is going to have parliament elections tomorrow. For the fourth time for the last 14 months we are going to elect somebody to govern us. I really hope that will put an end to this endless flow of political advertisement, speeches and other craziness.

Too many politics, too many politicians for poor Ukraine! Ok, we have the fourth elections tomorrow, and I'll vote for nobody the fourth time - just to send my message to those politicians (both from "orange revolution" and "opposition" camps) - you are not good to become presidents, deputies, majors, etc.
