OMG, today I received payment for my <a target="_blank" href="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/devtools/eclipse/">Google SOC project</a>. Gee, I've never got that much money for a software project! My thanks to Google and my mentors Carsten, Harald, Roberto. Thanks also to Zack for pointing me to this program. Special thanks to Roberto for being so enthusiastic about Eclipse. I'd never touched that piece of code without you&nbsp;;) Great&nbsp;:)
