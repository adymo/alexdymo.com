Great news on my [Ruby Performance](http://ruby-performance-book.com) book. First, I have signed with the Pragmatic Bookshelf to write and publish it. Second, the book itself is well underway.<!--more-->

I actually signed the contract with the publisher back in May, but kept things silent until I make a substantial progress with the book.

I'm glad I went through the publisher route for the book. For a newbie writer like me they provide a ton of value. Of course, I get to work with an outstanding editor who fixes my writing and teaches me to express my thoughs better. But there's more. They have an in-house process that forces you to rethink the book in general and restructure your content. End result is that each chapter from the book has a tangible value for the reader. Looking back, I see how my first two chapters I wrote before May were just a pile of poorly organized content that didn't really teach anything useful.

The publisher also adds motivation. Remember that "carrot and stick" thing? So now I have both. My carrot is the number of people I have on the [book's mailinglist](http://ruby-performance-book.com). And PragProg pokes me with their stick with schedule and milestones. Writing is hard. Without the stick I would procrastinate more than write.

But I like carrots too, so if you're interested in knowing more about Ruby and Rails performance, [signup for the book's mailinglist here](http://ruby-performance-book.com).
