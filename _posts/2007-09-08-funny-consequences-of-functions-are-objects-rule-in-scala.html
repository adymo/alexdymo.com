title: "Funny Consequences of \"Functions are Objects\" Rule in Scala"
header: Blog
---
<p>
Scala language is an unique combination of interesting language features and clear and concise syntax which is so rare in the world of programming languages.
</p>
<p>
Scala is truly object-oriented. This does mean that everything is an object, even functions. Err, functions you'd ask? Yeah, functions are indeed objects but that wasn't a surprise for me because I've seen and used that in Javascript. But function inheritance indeed was a surprise.
</p>
<p>
How can that be possible? Martin Odersky gives an example that functions with one argument in Scala are objects that mix this trait:
</p>
{% highlight scala %}
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  def apply(x: A): B
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Traits are the Scala implementation of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">mixins</a>. For C++ guys mixin is just a multiple inheritance. For Ruby guys trait is more like a module. The difference is that in Ruby you'd "include" the module into your class and in Scala you'd "extend" the class with a trait.
</p>
<p>
In the example above "-A" means that function that has AnyRef as an argument inherits a function that has a String argument. Take a look at this magical example:
</p>
{% highlight scala %}
object MyProg {
    def doSmthStr(a: String): Int = a.length
    def doSmthAny(a: AnyRef): Int = a.hashCode
    def compute(function: AnyRef => int) = {
        function("Haha")
    }
    def compute2(function: String => int) = {
        function("Haha")
    }
    def main = {
        // not possible because doSmthStr is of type String => int
        // which is supertype of AnyRef => int
        compute(doSmthStr)
        // possible because doSmthAny is exactly of type AnyRef => int
        compute(doSmthAny)
        // possible because doSmthStr is exactly of type String => int
        compute2(doSmthStr)
        // possible because doSmthAny is of type AnyRef => int
        // which inherits String => int
        compute2(doSmthAny)
    }
}
MyProg.main
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Isn't that cool, the function doSmthAny with AnyRef (aka Object in Java) argument inherits the function doSmthStr with String argument and therefore can be used whenever we need doSmthStr. Amazing!!!
</p>
<p>
Even more amazing is when the return types in those functions are different. For a function to be the subtype of another function we not only require its argument to be a supertype, but its return value to be a 
subtype. Citing <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf" target="_blank">Scala by Example</a> book:
</p>
<blockquote>
function S=>T is a subtype of S'=>T' if S' is a subtype of S and T is a subtype of T'
</blockquote>
<p>
where S=>T is a function defined as:
</p>
{% highlight scala %}
    def function(arg: S): T
{% endhighlight %}
