title: KDevelop in Facebook Open Academy Program 2014

I'm excited to report that I'll have 3 students working on KDevelop as a part of [Facebook Open Academy Program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-open-academy-bringing-open-source-to-cs-curricula/10151806121378920).<!--more--> The program is similar to Google Summer of Code with one important difference. It is held as part of a university student's CS education. Successful students will receive an academic credit for their open source contributions.

I got invited to be a mentor this year because of my previous involvement in Google Summer of Code program. I agreed and I'll manage, mentor and evaluate work of 3 students: David Stevens and Todd Nowacki from CMU and Michael Ferris from Polytechnic school of Montreal.

Our tentative plans for this year Open Academy are bugfixing and feature development of KDevelop-Clang C++ language support plugin.
