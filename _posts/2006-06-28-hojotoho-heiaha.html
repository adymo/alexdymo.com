Today I finally finished listening to the Wagner's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen">"Der Ring des Nibelungen"</a> opera (CD recording only alas). The complete Ring Cycle took me exactly four days to finish listening but I don't regret of any single hour spent! Only now I think I can understand Nietzsche's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy_Out_of_the_Spirit_of_Music">"The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music"</a> better. Indeed when Dionysian and Apollonian origins join they form something that is equally solemn (the music) and tragical (the epic) but leaves you anyway exhilarated.

I'm still sitting here, humming Hojotoho!&nbsp;;) and reading more about Nibelung. Honestly, these days I discovered a previously unknown to me Norse mythology and epic. I didn't think of such rich mythical worlds existed outside the Greece. Obviously, I need to learn more (just ordered a book with West European epics collection, it will be a nice addon to my collection of Greek, Roman and Slavonic mythology).
