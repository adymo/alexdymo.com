<p>
New <a href="https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/devtools/plugins/kdev-ruby" target="_blank">KDevelop Ruby language support</a> plugin is now production ready&nbsp;:) Why? Because it opens my huge (and proprietary) Rails-based project without any single crash.<!--more-->

<p>
Thanks to Miquel and Milian who helped to make it happen!
</p>
<p>
Get it <a href="https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/devtools/plugins/kdev-ruby/repository" target="_blank">here</a> and try it out for yourself now.
</p>
<p>
Old stable Ruby support plugin for KDevelop is still available <a href="https://github.com/adymo/kdevelop-ruby" target="_blank">here</a> in case you're not feeling adventurous.
