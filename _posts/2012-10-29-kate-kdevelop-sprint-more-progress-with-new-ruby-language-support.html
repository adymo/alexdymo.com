title: "Kate/KDevelop Sprint: More Progress with New Ruby Language Support"
header: Blog

<p>
More news about the new <a href="https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/devtools/plugins/kdev-ruby" target="_blank">KDevelop Ruby language support</a> plugin.
</p>
<p>
This week saw many improvements on parsing and semantic analyzing side. Just to name a few, parser is now able to recognize even the most strange heredocs, properly distinguish between classes and modules, support class methods, autorequire Rails code and more. <a href="http://www.mssola.com/" target="_blank">Miquel</a> who did all those amazing things can probably tell you more about that, so let's wait for his blog posts&nbsp;:)
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile KDevelop got two major new features - new file templates and unit testing support. So Ruby plugin now has new class template which you can already use, and a preliminary support for Test::Unit which you cannot yet use (it's not yet finished and committed).

Thanks to Joseph and KDE e.V. for sponsoring the sprint!
