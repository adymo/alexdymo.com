<p>
The deadline for Google SOC applications is really soon (TM) so I'm here to invite you to join KDevelop team this summer and have a lot of fun!
</p>
<p>
We have a lot of interesting proposals in our website for you and apart from C# support they are all still free.
</p>
<p>
If you are student, KDevelop user and know programming - join! Don't worry about KDevelop codebase being large. It's modular and we will give as much help as we can.
</p>
<p>
The greatest project proposals are "Unified code/header editing" and "Next-gen version control" but you're free to make your own. Everything that is about programming language parsing, code completion and refactoring is always welcome! Support for a build system of your choice also looks like a good project to hack on.
