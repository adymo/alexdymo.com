Looks like this time we did it right! KDevelop will have 3 summer of code projects contrary to only 1 last year&nbsp;:) This is awesome!
</p>
<p>
The overall number of KDevelop applications was 15 and 5 of them were inside the first 50. The interesting thing is that 6 proposals were aimed for "C# parser/integration". Ok, people, we finally began to understand. You need C# support in KDevelop, the thing we (KDevelop devels) has not been paying attention to for several years ;)

I wish we had higher limit for KDE projects, but in any case it's great to see 24 nice applications approved! Thanks to Google again!

Ok, now back to work. It's going to be a "hot" summer for me cause I'm mentoring two of our three students. Another one goes to our 4.x series maintainer Matt Rogers. Carsten Pfeiffer, Vladimir Prus and Andras Mantia kindly agreed to help us as co-mentors. Thanks&nbsp;:)
