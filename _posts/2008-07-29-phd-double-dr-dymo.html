The PhD saga is officially over today! In April I've got my Candidate of Sciences diploma and today I've received my PhD diploma. Yeah, one of the pros of defending your dissertation in Ukraine is that you get two diplomas for one dissertation&nbsp;;) And of course the cons side is that you have to wait for governmental approval. The wait time for me was more than 7 months. Anyway, it's finally over now&nbsp;:)
