Those two words pretty much describe my experience of Malaga beach&nbsp;:) The sun was mostly under the clouds but still it was really hot&nbsp;;) The Mediterranean Sea was great (warm and calm) but too salty to my taste. People, you should come to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea">Crimea (Ukraine)</a> to the Black Sea cost. The water there is as warm but much cleaner (because there's no sand, only pebble) and also it contains twice less salt&nbsp;;). Anyway, I enjoyed much swimming in the sea&nbsp;:)
