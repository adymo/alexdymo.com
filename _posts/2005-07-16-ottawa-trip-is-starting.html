Today my trip to Ottawa is starting. I will give two tutorials - one at DesktopCon (19th) and another at LinuxSymposium (20th). Guys from Xandros were so kind to make this possible by sponsoring me&nbsp;:)

PS: Another thing everybody is wondering about is where is KDevelop Conference dot story. Well, once KDevelop4 is commited to svn, the story will be there&nbsp;;)
