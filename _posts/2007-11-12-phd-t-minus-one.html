<p>
Today was finally the day of my PhD thesis defense! The defense went very well, the scientific council of my university approved my work with 10 votes "for" and 0 votes "against" and was overall pleased with my research&nbsp;:)

So now I need only to do nothing but wait for state examination board to approve the work and issue the PhD diploma.
