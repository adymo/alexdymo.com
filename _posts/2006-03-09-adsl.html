Gee, at last I got a permanent internet connection. Looks like the progress has finally made its way to my home&nbsp;:) It's an &lt;2Mbit ADSL connection with 1.5Gb of prepaid traffic for 183 UAH (~30 euro) per month. Quite expensive but at least I won't be counting minutes of damn slow dialup&nbsp;;)

What's more interesting, is that a device which I am connected through is a DLink 500T ADSL router with <i>MontaVista Linux</i> operating system inside. It's just amazing how can a full-blown Linux system with apache, firewall, etc. live and work fast on a small flash drive&nbsp;:)
