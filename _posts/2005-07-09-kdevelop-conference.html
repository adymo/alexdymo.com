The conference is over now. I'm sitting at home and writing this blog atm. Hope others got to their destinations without problems. I spent great time in Kiev, too bad we had only one week.

The next step will be writing a dot story covering our achievements during the week, I'll do it a bit later after I recover&nbsp;;)
