Yep, New Year has come to Ukraine for the second time! It was 1918 when Soviet Russia adopted Gregorian calendar. And the difference between Julian and Gregorian calendar was -13 days then. I don't know how that happened but people in ex-Russian Empire, ex-USSR countries still unofficially celebrate the New Year by Julian style calling January 14 the "Old New Year". So, happy "Old" New Year!&nbsp;:)
