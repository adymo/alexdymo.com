Today I joined the SuSE 10.1 users community. I've installed it on my laptop replacing 9.3. Everything went fine and pretty fast (yes, I've turned beagle off at installation&nbsp;:) ). Problems came thereafter. Networkmanager + konqueror combination became to annoy me though. When networkmanager thinks it's disconnected from my local home network, konqueror disagrees to go to any url, even local. For example, it does not connect to localhost:3000 where my rails app lives. Firefox does not care about networkmanager apparently and works fine. Otherwise, the system looks and works ok so far. I do appreciate working suspend-to-disk and ultra-fast KDE startup!
