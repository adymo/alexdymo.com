Finally I found the bravery to get Hofstadter's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">GEB (GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach)</a> book from the shelf and start reading it. To this moment I've only read an introduction and suddenly realized that those strange loops and self-references that the author thinks of as the core to understand the consciousness and "I-ness" of a human being feel so familiar for me. I've been teaching AI for two years and I always stress the self-reflection as the only one important thing that differentiates humans from (for example) computer programs (in their current stage). Good to know you're not alone in your thoughts (and you're not the first one). Now I got really interested in reading the book till the very end&nbsp;:)
