As Thiago <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2735">noted</a>, the deadline for Google Summer of Code applications is approaching. And I'd like to note that we have not many applications for KDevelop related projects yet. Last year there were about 7-8 (or more), 3 of which were accepted. This year we have 2 applications filled and 1 pending. What does that mean? This means that you have a chance to get your KDevelop-related project accepted. <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Go ahead!</a>
