When I was a child I was interested in the design of planes and dirigibles. I was keen on dirigible volume and statics calculations
therefore I studied statics and could find an integral of the curve long time before school teachers started to teach me that.

Then my interests suddenly shifted to the History of Ukraine. I was byuing and reading tons of books on history and
after several years of study I could tell the whole history of Ukraine from 860 AD to 1919 AD. Probably I still
can do that now but with less accuracy of course ;)

My grandparents wanted me to play piano, so I was learning to play it approx. for 6 years. While I never became
a good player I still like classical music and organ in particular. Each time I have the opportunity I
visit concert halls to listen to the organ. And of course, J.S. Bach is my favorite composer :)
I must admit though that music from Czech composers is as pleasant to listen as Bach's.<br>
However at this moment I could listen to probably every music in the world. I've got no strong preference.

I've enjoyed programming for more than eight years. C++, Ruby and (to smaller extent) Java are my favourite languages.
But when I've started to teach an AI course at the University I began to like Prolog as well. 
The power and mathematical strictness of the language bought me in a couple of days :)

From other things I like I can mention reading National Geographic (Ukrainian ed.), Scientific American and Popular
Mechanics (Russian ed.). I enjoy travelling. I like walking in the early morning watching the beauty of the nature. Despite that
I also like sleeping till noon ;). Heh, there are certainly much more things I like. They will just constitute too long
list to write it here.
